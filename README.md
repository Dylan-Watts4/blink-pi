<h1>BlinkShare</h1>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Blink share is a project which takes use of a raspberrypi zero 2w acting as a USB in order to retrieve local files
from the blink hub. It will then use FTP to transfer the files to a local server and host the using Node.js. The main goal on this project is to save money on cloud storage if you have a sufficient local storage solution.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

* RaspberryPi zero 2w
* Local server or device with high uptime and FTP capabilities
* At-least ~400 MB of storage on RaspberryPi zero 2W due to blink module requiring 300 MB for a write
* Sufficient storage on server for storing clips
